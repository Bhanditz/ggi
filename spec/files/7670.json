Photo by Michael &quot;Mike&quot; L. Baird, mike [at} mikebaird d o t com, flickr.bairdphotos.com; Canon 1D Mark III, Canon 600mm f/4.0 Lens with Circular Polarizer (it had a significant effect) resting on a large bean bag on a rock at water's edge about three feet above water level.&nbsp;<i>Tech Note:</i>  I needed my better Beamer flash - lacking that, I overexposed one full stop to get the details in the dark fur, at the expense of washing out some detail in the background.  This set has a bit of a dull look, less vibrant than normal, due probably to the harsh sunlight.&nbsp;* This was a bit blurry and not tack sharp, but I liked the pose here and it looks ok at the large thumbnail size anyway.  Too bad the Mom's eyes were not open more.  I took hundreds of shots (filled an 8GB card, shoot RAW of course) trying to get a better one, until I lost all the light at day's end.
