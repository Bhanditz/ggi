        %a{ href: "http://www.mnh.si.edu/ggi" } Global Genome Initiative (GGI) 
        is a collaborative effort to create a solid foundation for genomic research through a global network of biorepositories and research organizations. GGI will preserve and study genomic diversity and increase access to genomic information from the key branches of the Tree of Life––expanding our contribution to the preservation and knowledge of life on our planet.

      %h2 The Future of Genomics in Biodiversity Research
    %p.c10
      %span.c2 Biodiversity research is becoming more and more dependent on 'omics technologies. Ever reducing sequencing costs will enable unprecedented digitization and understanding of the planet's biological heritage. As such, DNA sequences are increasingly the core components of both evolutionary theory and ecological investigations. These data are of limited value however unless contextualized in a phylogenetic framework. Right now, we have genomic reference libraries for only a handful of model species. These model species (e.g. nematode, fruit fly, mouse) have provided valuable insight within all domains of biological studies. GGI intends to facilitate the rapid increase of model species across the Tree of Life. By creating a comprehensive reference collection of genomic samples that represent global biodiversity, GGI provides the templates to create the genomic scaffold for all life and the context of genetic expression for all species. Advances in the understanding of how complex structures in organisms are built, of how natural selection and adaptation occur, and of how ecosystems function all benefit from GGI's effort to lock down these digital blueprints during this period of global change.

        The genome of every organism contains information that may someday yield vital solutions to medical, environmental, energy, security, and agricultural problems. Our ability to realize these discoveries is not guaranteed. It is in fact threatened by habitat and species loss and by a lack of collaboration among the world's biorepositories and research organizations. The Global Genome Initiative aims to overcome these challenges and safeguard Earth's genomes for future biodiversity research by
