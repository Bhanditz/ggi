# Global Genome Initiative (GGI) portal

The GGI portal will enable biodiversity researchers to quickly figure out where
knowledge exists and does not exist, and allow them to narrow down where to
focus new effort.

Data is being gathered from a variety of sources and deposited into
[TraitBank][9], a groundbreaking tool that provides a searchable and open
digital repository for organism traits across all of life.

Powered by the [Encyclopedia of Life's API][10], the GGI portal will extract
and analyze attributes from TraitBank to determine the current state of
knowledge for every biological family.

The GGI portal is being developed by the [Encyclopedia of Life][11] team
for the [Global Genome Initiative (GGI)][12].
